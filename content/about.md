**I am an Architect, an Engineer.**

What makes me qualified? I started using GNU+Linux at an early age and have used it ever since. I love it. And when I think of what I can build with multiple Linux systems, I see something more grand than a solar system. Looking closely I am fascinated by the fine details, and every time I blink, I finish absorbing more information about the systems that power our computer networks. It brings me joy.

Hence the name Kaiif. Kaiif is a transliteration of the Russian word кайф, a word which you can use in a sentence like you would _joy_ in English. However, the word has associations with bliss and euphoria.

The Linux kernel is the engine, and its gears move our world.
